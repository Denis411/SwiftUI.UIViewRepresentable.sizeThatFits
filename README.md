This is a draft. It is not supposed to be "clean"

Version 2 368ce44fadeba539035f4559b31a2573d76614f9

The height of the internal views is synchronized with the UIViewRepresentable height because the internal constraints provide enough information to lay out themselves. It means that a view has enough constraints to cumpute its frame authomatically
